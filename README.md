# 🧠 LLM Engineering (Dockerized Dev Environment)

This project sets up a **fully containerized** environment for developing with LLMs, AI libraries, and Jupyter Lab — with **no local Conda or Python installation** required.

## 🔧 What's Included

- **Miniconda** + Mamba for Python environment management
- **Tiered install**: splits dependencies to avoid memory issues
- **Jupyter Lab** as the main UI
- Preinstalled libraries for:
  - 📊 Data science: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
  - 🤖 AI/LLM: torch, transformers, langchain, sentence-transformers
  - 🧰 Tools: dotenv, openai, pydub, psutil, twilio

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone & build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/llm_engineering.git
cd llm_engineering
docker compose up --build
````

### 2. Access Jupyter

Visit [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) in your browser. The token will appear in the console log.

## 📦 Daily Development

Using `docker compose down` is quite destructive to use often because of the length of time it takes to do a `docker compose up`. Better to stop the enviironment and restart it again until you have to clean up resources.

```bash
docker compose stop
docker compose start
```
which is the equivalent of...
```bash
docker compose restart
```


## 🔐 API Keys via `.env`

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
GOOGLE_API_KEY=xxx
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=xxx
```

These are accessible in your notebooks using `dotenv`.

## 💡 Notes

* All dependencies are installed inside the container.
* Environment is built in tiers to avoid memory crashes.
* Your project files are mounted into the container via volume.

## 📦 Clean Up

```bash
docker compose down         # Stop and remove the container
docker system prune -a      # Remove all images/containers (careful!)
```
